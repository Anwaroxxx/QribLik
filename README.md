## What We Learned

This project was never just about building a web app. It was about learning how to build things *together* — which turned out to be the harder challenge.

**Working as a team is a skill of its own.** Eight people, eight opinions, eight different ways of writing code. We had to agree on conventions, on structure, on what "done" actually means. That kind of alignment doesn't come automatically — it takes conversations, compromises, and a lot of patience. We learned that the best teams aren't the ones who never disagree, they're the ones who disagree well.

**Git conflicts are just people conflicts in disguise.** When two teammates modify the same file, git shows you a merge conflict. But really, what it's showing you is two people who both cared enough to work on the same thing. We learned to resolve those conflicts calmly — read both versions, understand what each person was trying to do, and find the solution that respects both. On the code side and the human side.

**Managing chaos is a real discipline.** There were days where three things were broken at once, someone's branch was two days behind, and the deadline was the next morning. We learned to stay calm under pressure, triage problems by priority, divide responsibilities clearly, and trust each other to handle their part. Panic is expensive. Focus is free.

**Communication saves more time than any tool.** A two-minute conversation about what a component is supposed to do saves two hours of debugging why it doesn't. We got better at writing clear commit messages, asking precise questions, and flagging blockers early instead of suffering in silence.

**Ownership matters.** When everyone is responsible for everything, nothing gets done. When each person owns a clear piece, things ship. We learned to define boundaries, respect each other's territory, and ask before touching someone else's work.

**Bugs are the best teachers.** The chatbot that refused to respond. The map card that wouldn't redirect. The scroll that locked on profile. Every single bug forced us to understand our own code more deeply than any tutorial ever could. Debugging is where you stop following instructions and start actually thinking.

**The product is always bigger than any one of us.** There were moments where someone's feature had to wait, or be changed, or removed entirely — because it wasn't what the product needed. We learned to detach from our own work just enough to ask "does this actually make Qriblik better?" That's a hard question when you spent two days on something. But it's the right one.

Qriblik is the result of all of that. Not eight people writing code in the same repo — eight people becoming better developers, better collaborators, and better at shipping real things into the world.
